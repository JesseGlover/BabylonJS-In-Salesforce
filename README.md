# BabylonJS-In-Salesforce
This repository will house demos of BabylonJS being used in Salesforce.

You will need the Babylonjs.min file saved in the org as a Static Resource. (No need for it to be stored as a zip file)

You will need to have My Domain set up and active in your org. (If you are using a trailhead org, my domain is already set up).
