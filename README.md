# BabylonJS-In-Salesforce
This repository will house demos of BabylonJS being used in Salesforce with Visualforce, Lightning Aura Components and Lightning Web Components..

You will need the Babylonjs.min file saved in the org as a Static Resource. (No need for it to be stored as a zip file)

You will need to have My Domain set up and active in your org. (If you are using a trailhead org, my domain is already set up).
